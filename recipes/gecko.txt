Audrey's Meatloaf
--------------
Time: 1 hour
Servings: 8

1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
6 slices White Bread
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
3/4 teaspoons Salt
4 whole Eggs, Beaten

Directions:
2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
10. Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes.
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
