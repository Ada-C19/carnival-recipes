Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.

Time: 4 hours
