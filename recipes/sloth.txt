Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour


Time: 4 hours

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
