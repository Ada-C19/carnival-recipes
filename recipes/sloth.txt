Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

Time: 4 hours

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.


1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vegetable oil.
13. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.
